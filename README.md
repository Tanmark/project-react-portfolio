# React Portfolio
Converting my previously Portfolio built in CSS and HTML, to a one built in React and using the Github API. 

## The problem
This projects was an exercise in React and API. In addition to that the styling is done in style components. My portfolio is currently not done and I will sort that out in a day or two (that is then what I would do with more time).
